   <a>One <code>a</code> link.</a> <br>

   <span class="link">This is a text with class <code>link</code>.</span>

   <div id="content">
    This div contains an <a>anchor</a>, a text with class <span class="link">link</span> and
    its id is <code>content</code>, hence it has a background color different from the rest
    of the document plus some <em>padding</em> to make it stand out.
   </div>

   <div>
    <p>
        This is another <code>div</code> that doesn't have the <code>content</code> id.
    </p>
    <p class="emphasis">
        This paragraph has <code>emphasis</code> class, so it is bold when the mouse hovers
        on it.
        This is not the best layout, but it explains the functioning of CSS.
